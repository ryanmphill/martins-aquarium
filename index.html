          <ul class="fishy__carelist">
            <li>Start with a small aquarium: As a beginner, it's best to start with a smaller aquarium, around 30 gallons or less, to help you get used to the maintenance and upkeep required for a saltwater aquarium.</li>
            <li>Invest in quality equipment: Quality equipment is important for the health of your fish and the overall success of your aquarium. Invest in a good filtration system, lighting, and a reliable heater.</li>
            <li>Do regular water changes: Water changes are an essential part of maintaining a healthy saltwater aquarium. It's recommended to change 10% to 20% of the water in your aquarium every two to four weeks.</li>
            <li>Test your water regularly: Testing your water for pH, salinity, and other important parameters is crucial for the health of your fish and invertebrates. Test your water at least once a week to ensure that the levels are within the recommended range.</li>
            <li>Research the fish and invertebrates you want to keep: Not all fish and invertebrates are suitable for a saltwater aquarium. Before buying any fish or invertebrates, do your research to ensure that they are compatible with your aquarium and with each other.</li>
            <li>Be patient: Saltwater aquariums take time to establish and can be challenging to maintain. Be patient and take the time to learn about the care and maintenance required for your specific aquarium.</li>
            <li>Join a local aquarium club: Joining a local aquarium club can be a great way to connect with other hobbyists and learn from their experiences.</li>
